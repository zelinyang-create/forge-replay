# Mini-Coding-Agent

This folder contains a small standalone coding agent:

- code: `mini_coding_agent.py`
- CLI: `mini-coding-agent`

It is a minimal local agent loop with:

- workspace snapshot collection
- stable prompt plus turn state
- structured tools
- approval handling for risky tools
- transcript and memory persistence
- bounded delegation

The model backend is currently based on Ollama.

## About This Fork

This repository is an Apache-2.0 fork of
[`rasbt/mini-coding-agent`](https://github.com/rasbt/mini-coding-agent). The
upstream project provides the minimal model-tool loop, workspace context,
structured tools, approval modes, JSON session resumption, context reduction,
and bounded read-only delegation.

ForgeReplay extends that teaching-oriented baseline toward a durable coding
agent harness. The work is being implemented incrementally and is expected to
add typed runtime events, a SQLite execution ledger, checkpoint recovery,
replay-safe file tools, per-run Git worktrees, supervised processes, and
fault-injection evaluation.

These capabilities are currently a roadmap, not completed performance claims.
Measured reliability and performance numbers will only be published together
with fixed task manifests, baseline commits, and raw evaluation artifacts.

The upstream baseline is tagged `upstream-baseline-717cae4`. See the
[durable harness technical design](docs/harness-technical-design.md) for the
architecture, implementation sequence, safety boundaries, and evaluation
methodology.

### Modification Notice

Compared with the upstream baseline, this fork currently adds its ownership
boundary, implementation roadmap, and technical design documentation. Future
changes to upstream-derived files will be recorded in commit bodies and release
notes while retaining the upstream copyright and Apache-2.0 license.

## Six Core Components

This coding harness is organized around six practical building blocks:

1. **Live repo context**  
   The agent collects stable workspace facts upfront, such as repo layout, instructions, and git state.
2. **Prompt shape and cache reuse**  
   A stable prompt prefix, which is separate from the changing request, transcript, and memory so repeated model calls can reuse the static parts efficiently.
3. **Structured tools, validation, and permissions**  
   The model works through named tools with checked inputs, workspace path validation, and approval gates instead of free-form arbitrary actions.
4. **Context reduction and output management**  
   Long outputs are clipped, repeated reads are deduplicated, and older transcript entries are compressed to keep prompt size under control.
5. **Transcripts, memory, and resumption**  
   The runtime keeps both a full durable transcript and a smaller working memory so sessions can be resumed while preserving important state via working memory.
6. **Delegation and bounded subagents**  
   Scoped subtasks can be delegated to helper agents that inherit enough context to help (but operate within limits).

## Requirements

You need:

- Python 3.10+
- Ollama installed
- an Ollama model pulled locally

Optional:

- `uv` for environment management and the `mini-coding-agent` CLI entry point

This project has no Python runtime dependency beyond the standard library, so you can run it directly with `python mini_coding_agent.py` if you do not want to use `uv`.

&nbsp;
## Install Ollama

Install Ollama on your machine so the `ollama` command is available in your shell.

Official installation link: [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)

Then verify:

```bash
ollama --help
```

Start the server:

```bash
ollama serve
```

In another terminal, pull a model. Example:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3.5:4b
```

Qwen 3.5 model library:

- [ollama.com/library/qwen3.5](https://ollama.com/library/qwen3.5)

The default in this project is `qwen3.5:4b`. If you have sufficient memory, it is worth trying a larger model such as `qwen3.5:9b` or another larger Qwen 3.5 variant. The agent just sends prompts to Ollama's `/api/generate` endpoint.

&nbsp;
## Project Setup

Clone the repo or your fork and change into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rasbt/mini-coding-agent.git
cd mini-coding-agent
```

If you forked it first, use your fork URL instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-user>/mini-coding-agent.git
cd mini-coding-agent
```



&nbsp;
## Basic Usage

Start the agent:

```bash
cd mini-coding-agent
uv run mini-coding-agent
```

Without `uv`, run the script directly:

```bash
cd mini-coding-agent
python mini_coding_agent.py
```

By default it uses:

- model: `qwen3.5:4b`
- approval: `ask`

For a concrete usage example, see [EXAMPLE.md](EXAMPLE.md).

&nbsp;
## Approval Modes

Risky tools such as shell commands and file writes are gated by approval.

- `--approval ask`
  prompts before risky actions (default and recommended)
- `--approval auto`
  allows risky actions automatically, including arbitrary command execution and file writes by the model; use only with trusted prompts and trusted repositories
- `--approval never`
  denies risky actions

Example:

```bash
uv run mini-coding-agent --approval auto
```



&nbsp;
## Resume Sessions

The agent saves sessions under the target workspace root in:

```text
.mini-coding-agent/sessions/
```

Resume the latest session:

```bash
uv run mini-coding-agent --resume latest
```


Resume a specific session:

```bash
uv run mini-coding-agent --resume 20260401-144025-2dd0aa
```


&nbsp;
## Interactive Commands

Inside the REPL, slash commands are handled directly by the agent instead of
being sent to the model as a normal task.

- `/help`
  shows the list of available interactive commands
- `/memory`
  prints the distilled session memory, including the current task, tracked files, and notes
- `/session`
  prints the path to the current saved session JSON file
- `/reset`
  clears the current session history and distilled memory but keeps you in the REPL
- `/exit`
  exits the interactive session
- `/quit`
  exits the interactive session; alias for `/exit`

&nbsp;
## Main CLI Flags

```bash
uv run mini-coding-agent --help
```

Without `uv`:

```bash
python mini_coding_agent.py --help
```

CLI flags are passed before the agent starts. Use them to choose the workspace,
model connection, resume behavior, approval mode, and generation limits.

Important flags:

- `--cwd`
  sets the workspace directory the agent should inspect and modify; default: `.`
- `--model`
  selects the Ollama model name, such as `qwen3.5:4b`; default: `qwen3.5:4b`
- `--host`
  points the agent at the Ollama server URL (usually not needed); default: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`
- `--ollama-timeout`
  controls how long the client waits for an Ollama response (usually not needed); default: `300` seconds
- `--resume`
  resumes a saved session by id or uses `latest`; default: start a new session
- `--approval`
  controls how risky tools are handled: `ask`, `auto`, or `never`; default: `ask`
- `--max-steps`
  limits how many model and tool turns are allowed for one user request; default: `6`
- `--max-new-tokens`
  caps the model output length for each step; default: `512`
- `--temperature`
  controls sampling randomness; default: `0.2`
- `--top-p`
  controls nucleus sampling for generation; default: `0.9`

## Example

See [EXAMPLE.md](EXAMPLE.md)

&nbsp;
## Notes & Tips

- The agent expects the model to emit either `<tool>...</tool>` or `<final>...</final>`.
- Different Ollama models will follow those instructions with different reliability.
- If the model does not follow the format well, use a stronger instruction-following model.
- The agent is intentionally small and optimized for readability, not robustness.
